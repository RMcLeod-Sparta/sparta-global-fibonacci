# Fibonacci TDD

## Deliverables

* Must be OOP
* Must be developed TDD approach
* Must be testable
* Must have README.md with instructions on how to run the code

## "Write a program that prints the sum of all the even numbers in the Fibonacci sequence below 4 million (starting at 1,2)"

## Instructions

Open the terminal and go to the "even_fibonacci_numbers" folder.
While immediately inside run the rspec command to
have the program print the sum of the even numbers of the sequence as well as results for the test cases.

## Test Driven Development

Tests for what numbers were expected to be at certain points in the array's were made before the code was made. Also tests for functions were made to see if I got the expected output.
